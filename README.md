# DNA-Classification-Dataset

During this step by step tutorial, we will explore the world of bioinformatics by using Markov models,
K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithms, support vector machines, and other common classifiers to classify short E. Coli DNA sequences.
This project will use a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that has 106 DNA sequences, with 57 sequential nucleotides (“base-pairs”) each.
